<p>
    This is an experiment in decision-making.
    The amount of money you earn will depend on the decisions you make and on the decisions other people make.
    Your earnings are given in tokens.
</p>
<p>
    This experiment has several parts.
    Your total earnings will be the sum of your earnings in each part.
    At the end of the experiment you will be paid in cash with each token worth {{ token_value }} in US dollars.
</p>
<p>
In addition, you will be paid ${{ show_up_fee }} for participation.
Everyone will be paid in private and you are under no obligation to tell others how much you earn.
</p>
<p>
Please do not talk with each other during the experiment.
    If you have a question, feel free to raise your hand, and an experimenter will come to help you.
