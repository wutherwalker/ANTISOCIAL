<p>
    You will be assigned randomly to a sender or to a receiver and your role will remain same during the session.
</p>
<p>
    The sender will learn the result of a coin flip performed by the computer.
    This coin flip has equal chances of resulting in "Heads" or "Tails."
    The sender then sends a message about this coin flip to the Receiver.
    Only the sender knows the true outcome of the coin flip.
</p>
<p>
    The receiver receives the message sent by the Sender, without observing the coin flip itself.
    Once the Receiver receives this message from the Sender, the Receiver chooses an action: H or T.
</p>
<p>
    The Receiverâ€™s action, together with the result of the coin flip,
    completely determines both the sender's and receiver's earnings for the round.
</p>
<p>
    Each round, you will be randomly matched to another participant.
    Senders will always be matched to receivers and vice-versa.
</p>
<p>
    After all rounds is done, one round out of the {{ num_rounds }} rounds will be randomly selected
    to determine what you are paid.
</p>
<p>
    Your participation in the experiment and any information about your payoffs will be kept strictly confidential.
    Your payment-receipt and participant form are the only places in which your name and ID number are recorded.
    You will never be asked to reveal your identity to anyone during the course of the experiment.
    Other participants will not be able to link you individually to any of your decisions.
    In order to keep your decisions private, please do not reveal your choices to any other participant,
    and please remain silent until the end of the experiment.
