<p>
    Welcome to this experiment in the economics of decision-making.

    Please read these instructions carefully, as the cash payment you earn at the end of todayâ€™s session will depend on your choices.
    If you have a question at any time, please raise your hand and the experimenter will come to your station to answer your question.

    There is no talking for the duration of this {{ duration }} minute session.
    Please turn off your cell phone and any other electronic devices.
</p>
<p>
    If you wish to leave before the experiment is finished, you may do so, but you will only receive the show-up
    fee of {{ show_up_fee }}.
</p>
<p>
    There are {{ players_per_session }} participants in each session. You will participate in {{ num_rounds }} rounds of
    decision-making using the networked computer workstations of the laboratory.
    Prior to the first round, {{ half_session }} of the participants will be randomly assigned the role of
    <span class="red">Red type</span> and the other {{ half_session }} the role of <span class="blue">Blue type</span>.
    Your role as a <span class="red">Red type</span> or <span class="blue">Blue type</span>  will remain fixed for
    all {{ num_rounds }} rounds.
</p>
{% if digit_span > 0 %}
<p>
    Each round, you will be asked to memorize a {{ digit_span }}-digit number.
    You must report this number correctly in order to get your payoff for that round.
