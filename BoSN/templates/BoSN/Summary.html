<ol>
    <li>At the beginning of each round, you will be randomly matched with one other participant
        from each of the three other classes to form a group of four participants, 2 <span class="red">Red</span> and
        2 <span class="blue">Blue</span>.</li>
    {% if digit_span > 0 %}
    <li>
        You will be given a new {{ digit_span }}-digit number to remember at the start of each round.
    </li>
    {% endif %}
    {% if announce_treatment %}
    <li>The computer selects the announcement according to the probabilities specified previously. Your
        screen will display the selected announcement as "The announcement is: "</li>
    {% endif %}
    <li>You will be prompted to enter your choice of action, clicking
        either X or Y.</li>
    {% if digit_span > 0 %}
    <li>
        You will have to report the {{ digit_span }}-digit number you were asked to memorize earlier.
        You must report it correctly to get your payoff for that round.
    </li>
    {% endif %}
    <li>The round is over after you and the participants you are matched with have entered their
    choices. The computer will provide a summary for the round:
        {%if announce_treatment %} the announcement made to you, {% endif %}
        the participants you are matched with, your choice of action, your matched participantsâ€™ choice of action,
        and your earning in points.</li>
    <li>This sequence will be repeated in each round, for {{ num_rounds }} rounds.</li>
