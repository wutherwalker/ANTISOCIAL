<p>
Before you choose an action in each round, both you and the other participants you are
matched with will receive an "announcement" by the computer program.
</p>
<p>
    These announcements  are selected randomly in each round:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>50% of the time, the computer will announce X to all participants;</li>
    <li>50% of the time, the computer will announce Y to all participants.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Thus when you see the announcement, you will also know the announcement that was made
    to the other participants with whom you are matched. The announcements do not have any effect on the payoffs.
    It is up to you whether or not to take the announcements into account when you make your action choices.
</p>
<p>
    Please wait for the other participants to finish reading these instructions.
